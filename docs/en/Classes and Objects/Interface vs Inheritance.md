### <span style="color:grey">interface Vs Inheritance:</span>

### <span style="color:grey">Inheritance:</span>

- We must define the implementation of the base class.
- The inherited classes depend on the base class.
- The hierarchy of deep inheritance produces high dependence, and this is not good what is sought is a low dependence and    high cohesion.
- The hierarchy of deep inheritance can be complicated if it is necessary to change the base class.
- The hierarchy of deep inheritance as a rule should not go from more than 3 levels of inheritance.
- Managing access to data with access specifiers can be more difficult with a great inheritance.
- Multiple inheritance in the same class is not compatible.

### <span style="color:grey">Interface:</span>

- The base class (Abstract class) It has no implementation.
- There are no dependencies between classes that implement the same interface.
- The implementation of multiple interfaces in the same class is allowed.
***
Interfaces and inheritance can work hand in hand, use at the same time taking each one as well as possible:
