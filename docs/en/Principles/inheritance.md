### <span style="color:grey">Inheritance:</span>

The inheritance allows the user to create classes based on other classes.Inherited classes can
use the base class functionalities, as well as some additional features that the user can
define.Eliminates the redundant code, avoid copying and paste and facilitates expansion.
This is very useful because it allows expanding or modifying (annuling) classes without changing the implementation of the base class code.
What do an old landline and a smartphone have in common?Both can be
classified as phones.Should they be classified as objects?No, since they also define the properties
and behaviors of a group of objects.A smartphone works like a normal phone, but it is also
Able to take pictures, navigate online and do many other things.Then, old landline
and the smartphone are secondary classes that expand the main telephone class.
