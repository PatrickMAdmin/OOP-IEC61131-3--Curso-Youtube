### <span style="color:grey"> Polymorphism:</span>

The concept of polymorphism is derived from the combination of two words: poly (many) and morphism (form).
Refactor cases of change/statements of ugly and complex cases.
Polymorphism allows an object to change its appearance and performance depending on the
Practical situation to be able to perform a certain task.
It can be static or dynamic:

- Static polymorphism occurs when the compiler defines the type of object;
- Dynamic polymorphism occurs when the type is determined during the execution time, which makes possible
For the same variable to access different objects while the program is running.
A good example to explain polymorphism is a Swiss razor.
A Swiss razor is a unique tool that includes a lot of resources that can be used to solve
different problems.When selecting the right tool, you can use a Swiss razor to
Make a certain set of valuable tasks.In the dual way, a simple summer that adapts
To deal with, for example, the types of INT, Float, String and Time data is an example of a polymorphic
programming resource.

### <span style="color:grey">How to get polymorphism?</span>

Polymorphism can be obtained thanks to interfaces and/or abstract classes.

- <span style="color:orange"><font size="4">Interface: (INTERFACE)</font></span>

    - They are a **contract that obliges** to a class A **implement** the **properties** y/o **methods** defined.
    - They are a template (without logic).

- <span style="color:orange"><font size="4">Abstract classes: (ABSTRACT)</font></span>

    - They are classes that cannot be instantized, they can only be implemented through inheritance.

- <span style="color:orange"><font size="4">Differences:</font></span>

    | Abstract classes | Interfaces | 
    | :--- | :--- |     
    | 1.- Limited to a single implementation.   | 1. It has no implementation limitation.     | 
    | 2.- They can define base behavior.     | 2. It exposes abstract properties and methods (without logic).
    
You can also get polymorphism by reference and/or pointers:

- <span style="color:orange"><font size="4">Reference: (REFERENCE)</font></span>

- <span style="color:orange"><font size="4">Pointer: (POINTER)</font></span>
