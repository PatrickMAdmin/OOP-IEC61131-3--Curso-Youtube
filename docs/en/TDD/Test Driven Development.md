### <span style="color:grey">Testing Development:</span>

The key of the DDD or Driven Development test is that in this process the tests are written before writing the code.This system manages not only to improve the quality of the final software, but also helps reduce maintenance costs.

The premise behind the development led by tests, according to Kent Beck, is that the entire code must be proven and refractorized continuously.
Kent Beck expresses it in this way: **Simply, evidence -led development aims to eliminate fear in applications development**.

- Is creating documentation, living and never obsolete specifications (that is, documentation).
- it is (re)Designing your code to do it and keep it easily verifiable.And that makes it clean, without complications and easy to understand and change.
- You are creating a security network to make confidence.
- Early notification of errors.
- Simple diagnosis of errors, since the tests identify what has failed.

### <span style="color:grey">The cycle and stages of the TDD:</span>
Development -led development means going through three phases.And again.

- Red phase: write a test.
- Green phase: Make the test by writing the code that monitors.
- Blue phase: refactorize.

***
- The development guided by tests must begin to be implemented as early as possible in the development of the software.
- The tests are only useful when they are executed.Configure a continuous integration system to build and test each component every time there is a change in the source code is the way to follow.
