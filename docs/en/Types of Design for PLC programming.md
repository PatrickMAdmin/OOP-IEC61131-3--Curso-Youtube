### <span style="color:grey">Types of design for PLC programming:</span>

Development engineering for OOP programming
- Component design, unit, device, object...
    - Objects are the basic object -oriented programming units.
    - A component provides services, while an object provides operations and methods.A component can be understood by all, while an object can only be understood by developers.
    - The units are the smallest code groups that can be maintained and executed independently
- Design for unit tests.
- UML design.

Units: (Example of units):
- I_InputDigital(p_On, p_Off)
- I_OutputDigital(M_ON, M_OFF)
- I_InputAnalog
- I_OutputAnalog
- I_Run:(M_Start, M_Stop)
