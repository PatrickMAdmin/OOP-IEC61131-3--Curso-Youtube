### <span style="color:grey">Description general:</span>
UML (Unified modeling language) It is a graphic language for the specification, design and documentation of object -oriented software.It provides a universally understandable basis for discussion between programming and other departments within the development of the system.

Unified modeling language itself defines 14 types of diagrams different from two main categories:

### <span style="color:grey">Structure diagrams:</span>

Structure diagrams schematically represent software architecture and are mainly used for modeling and analysis (For example, project design, system requirements specification and documentation).

In Codesys and on Twincat we will have the diagram:

- UML class diagram (tip: Structure Diagram)

### <span style="color:grey">Behavior diagrams:</span>

Behavioral diagrams are unique executable and semantic models from which the application code can be generated (models -based architecture).

In Codesys and on Twincat we will have the diagram:

- UML Statechart (tipo: Behavior diagram)

### <span style="color:grey">OOP and UML:</span>
### <span style="color:grey">Object -oriented programming (OOP) and UML Do you always have to use together?</span>

 - The combined use of OOP and UML offers many benefits (see next question), although it is not mandatory.Object -oriented application programming is also possible without using UML.Also, UML can be used in PLC projects, which are not based on object -oriented programming.
 ### <span style="color:grey">What are the benefits of using OOP and UML together?</span>

 - To make the most of object -oriented programming, the structure of object -oriented software should be designed and created before implementation (for example, what classes are available, what is your relationship, what functionalities offer, etc.).Before, during and after programming, documentation helps to understand, analyze and maintain the software.
 - As a tool for software analysis, design and documentation, UML offers options to plan, create and document the application.UML is particularly suitable for object -oriented implementations, since modular software is particularly suitable for representation with the help of graphic language.
 - For the sample, the class diagram is used to analyze and create the structure of the program.The more modular the software structure is, the easier and efficient the class diagram can be used (for example, graphic representation of separate functions blocks with individual methods to provide functionalities, etc.).
 - The status diagram can be used to specify the sequence of a system with discreet events.The more consistent the orientation to objects and events of the software structure, the more transparent and effective (For example, the behavior of modules/systems is based on a state model with states (As start, production, pause); Within the states are the corresponding functionalities, which are encapsulated in methods (As start, execution, pause, etc.)).
